# 🤖 KNN-Based CPU Scheduling Simulator

This project implements a **machine learning-based CPU scheduling simulator** using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to dynamically choose the most suitable scheduling strategy for each process: **FIFO** or **Round Robin (RR)**.

## 🚀 Project Overview

In traditional OS schedulers, processes are scheduled using fixed algorithms. Here, we enhance flexibility by using KNN classification to predict the best scheduling class (queue 0 = FIFO, queue 1 = Round Robin , queue 2 = SJF ) based on process features.

### 📊 Input Features for Each Process
- `pid`: Process ID
- `arrival_time`: Time when process enters the system
- `memory_required`: Amount of memory needed
- `cpu_brust_time`: Estimated CPU time required
- `priority`: Priority of the process
- `queue_id`: Target queue (used for training data)

## 🧠 How It Works

### ⚙️ KNN Classification
1. **Training Phase**:
   - Load historical process data (`training_data.csv`)
   - Fit KNN with process attributes and their target queue

2. **Prediction Phase**:
   - Load new processes (`testing_data.csv`)
   - Predict the best scheduling queue using KNN
   - Assign each process to either FIFO or RR queue

### 🗂 Scheduling Phase
- **FIFO Scheduler**: Executes processes in the order of arrival
- **Round Robin Scheduler**: Executes with time slicing (quantum = 2)
